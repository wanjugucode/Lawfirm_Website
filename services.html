                        <p class="description">We have dedicated specialists experienced in all stages of transactions
                            when buying, selling or leasing real property. We have worked with a multitude of
                            corporations, including clients within the hotel and leisure sector, and even foreign
                            governments investing in Kenyan properties, at all times ensuring fairness, honesty, and
                            integrity. This area of law intersects with other areas such as equity and trust law, and
                            Bryant's Law approaches real estate and land transactions from this holistic perspective.</p>
